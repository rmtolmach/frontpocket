Three players hold hands and the fourth player is \"it.\" Whoever is \"it\" chooses one of the three players to tag. When the game starts, the player who is \"it\" tries to tag the player they chose while the two players holding hands with that player try to prevent them from getting tagged. Reaching across the triangle, either over or under the hands, is not allowed. When the player is tagged, switch roles. " },

This person in the winker. Everyone opens their eyes. The winker eliminates other players by winking at them. If you are winked at, silently count to 5, then announce that you're out and put your head down. If the winker eliminates everyone, then they win. If a player thinks they know who the winker is, before they get winked at, they can raise their hand and say they have a suspect. Such as 'I suspect that Sally is the winker.' If Sally is not the winker, then the accuser is eliminated." },
