# Back Pocket Games

Working with groups of children can be stressful for many reasons. One reason is the spontaneous need to quickly organize an activity to entertain a group. My app will alleviate the stress from that situation by putting games in your back pocket. Users choose from a few options and the app quickly generates games based on those preferences.

Back Pocket Games uses MongoDB as the database, Rails as the backend api where all the games live, and Angular 2 on the front end.

The [backend](https://github.com/rmtolmach/frontpocket) is a Rails api with a MongoDB database of 20 games.
